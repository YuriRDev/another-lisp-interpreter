# ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è ALI - Another Lisp Interpreter
Yepp, that's just another one, among millions and millions. But... what makes this one so special? Nothing. 

The initial design (probably the version that you are seeing this README) aims for simple design implementation, but after the goal is performance.

## Examples
```lisp
(
    (+ 1 2)         ; outputs 3
    (+ 2 2 2)       ; outputs 6
    (* 4 2 1) 
)
```

## What you can do
if \ ifelse
define x (EXPR)
